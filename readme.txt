My project includes several classes all which work together to create this game. If I had more time, I would have implemented the smart AI bonus for this assignment. If I had to implement this game all over again, I would have made my isOverallWinner and isWinner methods a little more different and made it easier to understand. It was kinda complex and took me quite a while. I printed the winners of each board and the board itself after every move, hopefully this counts as the bonus for the legal moves for each player as we know the boards without the winner is the one with legal moves, and showing the board shows where it is possible to make a move.

I have finished the project completely and followed the instructions entirely and it runs perfectly and outputs the winner at the end.
